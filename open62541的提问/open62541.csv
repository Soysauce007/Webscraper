Sounds good.
Question 1:

Subscribing application (It is subscribing to 4 hardcoded DataSetFields. The rst field is a DateTime type. So as far as I understand, it should be able to subscribe to the publishing timestamp field.)


Yes, the implementation seems to have a publisher that publishes the dateandtime for every 100ms interval. And also the subscriber should subscribe the same. Your understanding seems to be perfect.


Question 2: So as you can see in the subscriber console, the four VariableNodes are successfully added (first of which is of type DateTime). But it seems like the subscribe application is not able to parse the timestamp withing the NetworkMessage.


I see you misunderstood the console print in the subscriber, because if I'm not wrong you expected a print near the ""Message Receive:"". And it is empty because it is just a print statement in ""UA_ReaderGroup_subscribeCallback"" in /src/pubsub/ua_pubsub.c in line:2392




if you want to see the value of the ""dateandtime"" from the subscriber information model, use the client gui and browse the information model when the subscriber is running. Then you can see the data change. The subscriber implementation doesn't seems to have a UA_server_readValue() API to read the variable value from the information model and display the value in the console print. If you want to read and print in the tutorial application use the UA_server_readValue() API in a separate call back and read repeatedly


Question 3: Also, I do not understand the console output of the publish application. It says that two nodes are not found. Why is that? Which nodes are they?


In the publisher if you browse the information model using the client tool you can find the objects without the parent node. And also it's not mandatory that objects should have a parent node name. Its a optional in modelling rule. That's the reason for this ""Node id not found"" console print. But to my understanding you don't need to worry about this, it means that it won't affect the publisher and subscriber working.


Question 4: I would like to use this subscriber implementation to subscribe to my published sensorvalues. But since the application is not able to subscribe to the timestamp correctly, I will have to solve this issue first.


You don't need to solve anything. It seems to be working fine.


Hope my answer helps.
Thanks,

Merlin"

Thanks for the help with that! I've used MQTT so I'll look into that some more.
As for your question, it has worked pretty well as far as I can tell. You just have to use a cross compiler, I usually compile on my desktop and then send to the Raspberry Pi. Also, you have to modify the code to work with 32 bits vs 64, but otherwise it has worked well."

Here is the implementation. Please feedback.
/*
* This implementation was done to measure the performance of the Publisher
* Subscriber implementation between two nodes on a VxWorks OS environment.
* The application logic is that, sending a counter data from NODE 1 and the
* NODE 2 receives it to compare if it is an incremented value. The same value
* is sent back to NODE 1, now NODE 1 gets the value and increments it by 1 and
* sends it back to NODE 2 where the round-trip measurement is done if it is an
* incremented value. This snippet was verfied with hardwared signal toggle.
*
* Notes: 
* Here both NODE 1 and NODE 2 will be running both Publisher and Subscriber applications
* NODE 1: Will receive the data and increment it by 1 and send to NODE 2
* NODE 2: Receives the data and checks if it is incremented and measurement is done.

you are looking at the right code to set the content during reading.

Two things are required:

Set and store the UA_FieldMetaData in the internal DataSet representation
Return the fieldmetadata in the onRead callback.

The UA_DataSetField structure (publishedDataSet->fields) contains a UA_FieldMetaData entry.

So you can copy that over during onRead.
But the UA_FieldMetaData is not automatically filled atm.

Most of the information can be read from the variable definition when the field is created.
We might have to extend the public API so that the user can fill in more MetaData information.

It looks like you forgot this part:
When compiling LwIP you need a file called lwipopts.h. In this file, you put all the configuration variables. You need to make sure that you have the following configurations there:

#define LWIP_SOCKET 1 // Enable Socket API (normally already set)
#define LWIP_DNS 1 // enable the lwip_getaddrinfo function, struct addrinfo and more.
#define SO_REUSE 1 // Allows to set the socket as reusable
#define LWIP_TIMEVAL_PRIVATE 0 // This is optional. Set this flag if you get a compilation error about redefinition of struct timeval"

https://forum.unified-automation.com/post11520.html
Response by the support team:

this is expected behavior. Typically when a node is being subscribed it already has a value (and a value always has a type). The DAView is obtaining the values datatype form the received value (received during first update). However if your node has no value the UaExpert will assume its type is ""NULL"", because it never has received a value. Reading the attribute (as suggested by you) makes no sense, because the node can change the valued datatype during runtime, so besides creating unnessecary load (by manually reading data type attribute), the datatype may still be different when being used. And of course you can write the value, just need to use the attribute window for writing.
In any case you should take a close look at the Server, why is it having nodes that have no value? That makes not much sense.

Summarized, every variable should be initialized with a specific value. The question now remains:

@jpfr Should we automatically create a empty not-null dummy value in the nodeset compiler, or should we leave this up to the stack user?"

To solve this problem I would suggest two possible solutions:

Introduction of a function to fill a node/subtree along hierarchical references with neutral values.

So I see two open connections.

Did you manually remove some of the response messages?

I only partially see the SecureChannel and session handshake.
Only the second WriteRequest returns a failure in the provided dump:

But even before that the second open session is returning this on the publish requests:

In our system all values are produced at fixed intervals: 10 ms, 100 ms and 1000 ms. I know the producing interval for each value, so if a client requests the item at a faster interval than it is being produced, I can revise the interval.
If a value is produced at 10 ms rate, but a client requests it at 1000 ms rate, I will sample it at 1000 ms. According to Nyquist theorem, the client would have to sample the value at half the interval the value is produced, which is wasting CPU cycles on the server.
Another example:

We have a value produced at 10 ms rate. Two clients connect to the server, one monitors the value at 10 ms and the other at 100 ms. Every 100 ms I would need to read the value from my data store twice, to serve both clients. If it would be possible for me to manage the monitored items myself, I would always sample the value once, but every tenth time I would provide the sample also for the slower client.
These optimizations might sound small, but in our system we have multiple connected clients with each one reading over 2000 nodes per second. When scaling up the CPU overhead starts to add up."

Hmm okay. Do you have some numbers on the increase in the CPU load?

That would be important to know to make a tradeoff decision.

When the monitored items are sampled from the server thread context, I cannot guarantee that each sample is recorded (assuming that the sampling interval is equal to the period on which the value is updated).

In general, to make sure you get all the updates, make the sampling interval just a bit faster than the update rate. Note that many clients can monitor the same value. All with different intervals and time offsets from the last sample.
What you propose would introduce a tight coupling between data generation and the clients. I don't think it is a good idea.
Also, the overhead can be quite large. If a process generates values at many kHz and a client monitors at 1/s, we'd have to check all the time when to actually take the sample. Or overwrite intermediate samples."

In the application we wrote, the Namespaces object does appears -- albeit missing the correct content. That's probably because we used the nodeset geenration python scripts that make explict calls to UA_Server_addNamespace() in the ua_server.c file.
For some reason, I can't replicate the same behavio using the tutorial_server_datasource.c example which makes the came calls.
Note on Compliance
As far as the specification goes (Part 5, Section 6.3.1, Table 9),  the Server object lists the Namespaces component as optional .

However, this component is much needed by the so called aggregating servers which are getting some traction these days (the one I can think of is the one that Microsoft uses for their AzureIoT stuff, and of course, we wrote our own as well)."

I have been looking at a way to ""cheat"" just to do some final testing at the interop this week.
In reality, as you are probably saying, things should start happening when the server adds datafields.
But in the meanwhile, I tried to modify the OnRead call in the ua_pubsub_ns0.c.
I'm not successful yet, because I don't have much time left and I'm just shooting in the dark.
The following code (very ugly and should NEVER be user) does succeed on the server side, but the client doesn't like it and eventually leads to bad outcomes.
But I put it here for you to look at and see if it can be easily ""steered"" in the right direction.
I'm making up the field name (using the tutorial sample I will only have one field all the times).
Aagin, this is just for you to see if modifying the OnRead this way makes sense. Clearly it needs to be improved.

Short answer: Yes
Long answer: I'm definitely in favour of semantic versioning. We need to find a good way to keep the Changelog updated and document all the major and minor changes.
It would be best if there are some automatic tools/bots which help us with that and check pull requests correspondingly.
I don't mind if we reach version 10.0 in a year, honestly do not care that much about version numbers, as long as they make sense = stick to semver.
@jpfr maybe the 1.0 release is a good starting point to enforce semver?"

If you used MQTT you saw that they use a callback for receiving messages and with UDP there is no such callback mechanism in the code. I think for now the polling remains because they need to do polling on the channel where they receive. Now I don't remember the details of the code but inside I saw that you have to do this polling to receive information at Subscriber side. I hope I'm understandable :)"

I'm not familiar with MS VC. I hope I'll be helpful even if I've worked on Ubuntu. When you compile the project you don't need only UA_BUILD_EXAMPLES but also the advanced options: UA_ENABLE_PUBSUB ON, UA_ENABLE_PUBSUB_ETH_UADP ON, etc. Including UA_ENABLE_PUBSUB_MQTT which enables the MQTT feature. Check if these options are all enabled and check that in the CmakeLists.txt in the folder examples contains this:

if(UA_ENABLE_PUBSUB_MQTT)

add_example(tutorial_pubsub_mqtt pubsub/tutorial_pubsub_mqtt.c)

endif()

Finally check also that UA_ENABLE_JSON_ENCODING is enabled for JSON encoding. After all these checks it should work. Let me know if you have any problems.

Sohail"

I added the changes and yes, this improves things.
I now have to understand if there is anything I should add in my code.
Let me explain details (sorry for the lengthy description, but I hope it helps).
Adding the Fix
I added the changes in #2802 . That basically exposes the PublishedData information correctly and without me needing to change the code in the tutorial_pubsub_publish.c file (it basically just works, as I'd expect).
Here's a screenshot:

However, the DataSetMetaData property of the DataSet is not announced correctly (but at least is not null anymore).
In this screenshot you see the comparison between the .NET server and the tutorial_pubsub_publish, where the Fields array is empty where it should instead list the one DataField for the current time:


Additional Improvements Needed
This part of the PubSub information model is important because it gives the potential subscribers the needed info to map the DataSetWriter's fields.
Look at the .NET Sample Config UI that now can successfully navigate to the remote writer dataset (now it doesn' t crash). But if I want to configure the DataReader, I am missing the necessary metadata:


Possible Next Steps
I looked at the code in the  src/pubsub/ua_pubsub_ns0.c  (the file changed by #2802) and I can see that a lot happens in the onRead  handler:
When the client browses to the  PublishedData property (around line 136) the following code maps the data from the published variable to the PublishedData fields. That's why we can see that info correctly in the client:
[...]
case UA_NS0ID_PUBLISHEDDATAITEMSTYPE: {
            UA_PublishedDataSet *publishedDataSet = UA_PublishedDataSet_findPDSbyId(server, *myNodeId);
            if(!publishedDataSet)
                return;
            switch(nodeContext->elementClassiefier) {
                case UA_NS0ID_PUBLISHEDDATAITEMSTYPE_PUBLISHEDDATA: {
                    UA_PublishedVariableDataType *pvd = (UA_PublishedVariableDataType *)
                            UA_calloc(publishedDataSet->fieldSize, sizeof(UA_PublishedVariableDataType));
                    size_t counter = 0;
                    UA_DataSetField *field;
                    LIST_FOREACH(field, &publishedDataSet->fields, listEntry) {
                        pvd[counter].attributeId = UA_ATTRIBUTEID_VALUE;
                        pvd[counter].publishedVariable = field->config.field.variable.publishParameters.publishedVariable;
                        //UA_NodeId_copy(&field->config.field.variable.publishParameters.publishedVariable, &pvd[counter].publishedVariable);
                        counter++;
                    }
                    UA_Variant_setArray(&value, pvd, publishedDataSet->fieldSize,
                                        &UA_TYPES[UA_TYPES_PUBLISHEDVARIABLEDATATYPE]);
                    break;
                }
[...]
However, when the client requests the DataSetMeta data (hence switching the nodeContext->elementClassiefier (spelling ;-) to UA_NS0ID_PUBLISHEDDATAITEMSTYPE_DATASETMETADATA) the only thing that happens (I think) it's copying the PublishedData.DataSetMetaData attributes to the DataSetMetaData property value. But at that point nobody has set anything in the publishedDataSet->dataSetMetaData fields.
//publishedDataSet->dataSetMetaData is EMPTY at this point so nothing will happen
 case UA_NS0ID_PUBLISHEDDATAITEMSTYPE_DATASETMETADATA: {
                    UA_Variant_setScalarCopy(&value, &publishedDataSet->dataSetMetaData, &UA_TYPES[UA_TYPES_DATASETMETADATATYPE]);
                    break;
                }
I don't have time now to attempt to fix this, but I figured I write this and later I keep looking at it while someone might be seeing this and get some ideas.
Thank you again for the tremendous help."

You receive the DataTypeArray together with the namespace definitions.

You could do a little bit of preprocessing before adding the DataTypeArray to the linked list in the server config.
For example by looking up the dependencies (via the NodeId of the type) and ensuring that DataType definitions that depend on one another end up in the same DataTypeArray.

E.g. by copying the relevant DataTypes to the current DataTypeArray.
That way we keep the encoding layer really simple and fast.

And the encoding layer can be ""standalone"" without dependencies to the Nodestore layer."

I followed the pull request #2613 and tried the implementation myself.

However after the merge many things don't work anymore.

For example when working with 1 ReaderGroup and 2 DataSetReader the subscribed variables wont receive any data.

  
    
      open62541/src/pubsub/ua_pubsub.c
    
    
        Lines 400 to 406

           if(pConnection->readerGroupsSize == 1) { 
        

        
          
               if(LIST_FIRST(&pConnection->readerGroups)->readersCount == 1) { 
        

        
          
               UA_LOG_INFO(&server->config.logger, UA_LOGCATEGORY_SERVER, ""only 1 DataSetReader available. This one will be used.""); 
        

        
          
               dataSetReaderErg = LIST_FIRST(&LIST_FIRST(&pConnection->readerGroups)->readers); 
        

        
          
               } 
        

        
          
            
        

        
          
           } 
        
    
  


I located the problem in this code which only allows a single DataSetReader when there is only 1 ReaderGroup. So everytime the stack tries to process the message it doesn't get any DataSetReader.
Also there is no checking for the publisherId AND writerId in this scenario! There might occur errors/problems when there are two ore more publisher with a different config!

@Fischer-Thomas, thank you for your interest in the subscriber implementation. Can you please use #2631 instead of #2613 as #2631 is the commit that was actually merged. Even in that case, our priority was to provide a quick implementation that focuses specifically on writing the subscribed value into the information model - this was previously not available and we are getting the ball rolling here for interested users. Additional items (including the ones you have mentioned) are definitely in our roadmap and we will be happy to let you know as soon as we have them and their dependencies in place. Please stay tuned for regular updates.
Regards,

PTP Sync (only software timestamp is possible on RPi3 and you need to do PTP specific changes to kernel and rebuild, 3hrs procedure)
PHC2SYS sync is needed
compensate for the poor accuracy due to non RT environment and software clock

Easier path:
easier measurement will be to send 1 byte to

node 2 and receive the same data at node 1 and try to find the overall time required for this and simply divide by 2 to get your latency. In this method you will be doing the measurement in the same time context/domain which removes you the headache of Ptp and PHC2SYS.
My RPi3 showed far better performance than yours even though I had a legacy Ethernet switch in between.

I would like to give a big thank you to your answers!
As I using the subscribe application as a basement for further extended the application, I would not only like to print the timestamp value to the console, but also store them in a variable to write them in a csv file.
As I understand correctly, one way to do this is to define a function myFunc which calls UA_Server_readValue(UA_Server *server, const UA_NodeId nodeId, UA_Variant *outValue). myFunc then casts the outValue to DateTime and writes it into the csv file.  myFunc is called in ua_pubsub.c line 1098 where it is executed everytime a new NetworkMessage is received.
BUT: as you can see in the interface of the UA_Server_readValue(UA_Server *server, const UA_NodeId nodeId, UA_Variant *outValue), the second parameter is the nodeId of the serverside datetime node.

From the perspective of the subscriber, I do not know this nodeId. So how can I retrieve this nodeId on runtime (not hardcoded)?

As the subscribe application defined unique fieldNames for 4 fields (in the fillTestDataSetMetaData() mehthod), is it possible to get the nodeId by fieldname?
Thank you both for your help !"

 I would like to ask you how the client (which is subscribed to the
published sensorvalues) can WRITE a value on the server over the network.
Like: I want the Client to set the temperature value to 0.
How can I accomplish this?

I was thinking about something like this:

static void updateCurrentTime(UA_Server *server) {
    UA_DateTime now = UA_DateTime_now();
    UA_Variant value;
    UA_Variant_setScalar(&value, &now, &UA_TYPES[UA_TYPES_DATETIME]);
    UA_NodeId currentNodeId = UA_NODEID_STRING(1,
""current-time-value-callback"");
    UA_Server_writeValue(server, currentNodeId, value);

}

But I cannot use the UA_Server_writeValue method because this is a
serverside method and I want to set the value from the client side.
Any suggestions?

Thanks a lot in advance!

 Hello @theresa95 <https://github.com/theresa95>,

 Sounds good.

 Question 1:
 Subscribing application (It is subscribing to 4 hardcoded DataSetFields.
 The rst field is a DateTime type. So as far as I understand, it should be
 able to subscribe to the publishing timestamp field.)

 Yes, the implementation seems to have a publisher that publishes the
 dateandtime for every 100ms interval. And also the subscriber should
 subscribe the same. Your understanding seems to be perfect.

 Question 2: So as you can see in the subscriber console, the four
 VariableNodes are successfully added (first of which is of type DateTime).
 But it seems like the subscribe application is not able to parse the
 timestamp withing the NetworkMessage.

 I see you misunderstood the console print in the subscriber, because if
 I'm not wrong you expected a print near the ""Message Receive:"". And it is
 empty because it is just a print statement in
 *""UA_ReaderGroup_subscribeCallback""* in /src/pubsub/ua_pubsub.c in
 line:2392

 if you want to see the value of the ""dateandtime"" from the subscriber
 information model, use the client gui and browse the information model when
 the subscriber is running. Then you can see the data change. The subscriber
 implementation doesn't seems to have a UA_server_readValue() API to read
 the variable value from the information model and display the value in the
 console print. If you want to read and print in the tutorial application
 use the UA_server_readValue() API in a separate call back and read
 repeatedly

 Question 3: Also, I do not understand the console output of the publish
 application. It says that two nodes are not found. Why is that? Which nodes
 are they?

 In the *publisher* if you browse the information model using the client
 tool you can find the objects without the parent node. And also it's not
 mandatory that objects should have a parent node name. Its a optional in
 modelling rule. That's the reason for this ""Node id not found"" console
 print. But to my understanding you don't need to worry about this, it means
 that it won't affect the publisher and subscriber working.

 Question 4: I would like to use this subscriber implementation to
 subscribe to my published sensorvalues. But since the application is not
 able to subscribe to the timestamp correctly, I will have to solve this
 issue first.

 You don't need to solve anything. It seems to be working fine.

 Hope my answer helps.

 Thanks,
 Merlin

Instead of locking a mutex, I'm using unique_lock (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/unique_lock) and call the lock/unlock in the loop on this.

Also suggest to add these lines to you thread 0 loop, otherwise my other thread was very unlucky of locking the mutex (it has take up to 5s):
std::this_thread::yield(); // < This line ensures that a waiting thread is executed
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(10));

@jpfr I've no problem preserving this in an FAQ, but as this is a C library a solution in with pthread would be more useful."

I dont know why my tcpdump didnt capture all the packages. Here is an new tcpdump with hopefully all package.

tcpdump.zip

The communication is not via wifi, but I know that there is a lot of traffic in our network.

But the Client has 192.168.25.31 and the Siemens S7 192.168.25.131, this should help filtering the tcpdump.
I didn't even know I had the UA Client running, this time I only had the open62541 Client running, but still got the same result.
But you can see that in the CreateSessionResponse SessionTimout is 30 sec.

Now I just read the current server time to keep the session alive, like so.
UA_Variant value;
UA_Client_readValueAttribute(client, UA_NODEID_NUMERIC(0, UA_NS0ID_SERVER_SERVERSTATUS_CURRENTTIME), &value);

I dont know if this is a good way of keeping the session alive or if there is a better solution?"

I am trying to use tutorial_pubsub_mqtt. It seems that when I compile the project with UA_BUILD_EXAMPLES it is not compiled.

I am struggling to create an C project in MS VC with tutorial_pubsub_mqtt.

By a chance do you have a repository where is tutorial_pubsub_mqtt built as an example?"
